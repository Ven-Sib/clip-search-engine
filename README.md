#  Visual Search Engine — React + Django + OpenAI CLIP

A powerful, AI-powered visual search engine that allows users to upload an image and instantly find visually similar images using OpenAI’s CLIP model. Built from scratch with a beautiful UI, smooth performance, and full-stack integration.

---

##  Features

-  Upload any image to search against a dataset of sample images
-  Returns top 3 visually similar matches using FAISS and CLIP
-  Built on OpenAI’s CLIP (ViT-B/32) for deep semantic + visual encoding
-  Frontend built with React + Tailwind CSS (fully responsive)
-  Backend powered by Django + PyTorch + FAISS
-  Reloadable index without server restart
-  Beautiful UI with background image, styled buttons, and responsive grid
